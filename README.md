# Gideon's Website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gfarrell/gtf.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gfarrell/gtf.io)

This is the source of my website at [www.gtf.io](https://www.gtf.io). It's
mainly to host my musings, projects, and some other things like podcasts,
restaurant reviews, and wine listings.

This is very much a work in progress, including the theming which is currently
aggressively spartan.

It is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
