<p>I am one of two cofounders of <a href="https://www.converge.io"
title="Converge">Converge</a>, a startup we founded in late 2014 to
build a physical intelligence layer for the construction industry in
order to address the glaring efficiency and sustainability problems in
what I would argue is one of the world's most fundamental industries. As
CTO I lead the technical functions in the business and spend most of my
time on technical architecture and vision.</p>

<p>Before founding Converge, I was a star-fancier-in-training at
King's College, Cambridge, where I read Natural Sciences, followed
by an MSci in Astrophysics in which I completed my thesis on <a
href="projects/x-ray-jets-solar-atmosphere/" title="master's thesis
on temperature bounds on x-ray jets in the solar atmosphere">the
temperature bounds on x-ray jets in the solar atmosphere</a>.</p>

<p>I have been programming for most of my life, initially in Python,
Javascript, and various shell languages, but now most of my time
is split between continually honing my environment (ArchLinux) and
experimenting in Haskell.</p>

<p>My core interests are in architecture and the built environment
(especially the construction of future environments and how such
environments influence the social structures that develop); the
intersection of human rights and cyberspace; and inducing social
change to tackle large-scale human problems like climate change (as a
counterpoint to techno-optimism/fatalism).</p>
