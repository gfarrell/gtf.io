Over the last 15 or so years I have cycled through many websites, from
early ones built in Dreamweaver (mostly to host cheatcodes for my
ActionReplay on Gameboy) through _very_ animated, interactive sites in
Flash followed by my own PHP CMS (all to host the burgeoning corpus of
3d graphics, photomanipulation, and photography I was churning out),
and eventually back to static sites. I have also tried blogging several
times, with Wordpress initially, then Ghost, and a little with Medium.

This website was the result of a desire to have a simple, fully-static
site which I could use to host various [musings](/musings) and
[projects](/projects), as well as other [things](/things) like podcasts,
wine listings, &amp;c..

The design is purposefully spartan. Web design often seems to favour
form over function. This is not just a contemporary issue, in the early
2000s, heavy use of blinking, attention grabbing effects, and marquee
text were legendary. It is also not simply an amateur problem, plenty of
professional designers are producing (sometimes) aesthetically beautiful
websites, but these are hard to use, or hard to read, or sometimes so
filled with white space as to resemble a piste at the start of the
season. The design will evolve, but I decided to start with a tabula
rasa (well, at least with the browsers' default stylesheets).

I am not a web designer. I do have a fairly strong aesthetic sense,
but coming up with great designs is not my main skill. At the moment
I am trying to strip everything back, except what is necessary. I
spend a lot of my time in a terminal, and a lot of modern web-based
software has drifted very far from a responsive (in terms of speed),
powerful interface. Most web software is slow, and feels unnatural
to use. For me, the epitome of usability is something like `vim`,
despite the steep learning curve. `vim` allows me to be extremely
productive if I am willing to invest the time into understanding
how it works, but I can also use its basic functionality by just
sitting in insert mode as if I were using `nano`. I do not want
the web to be just like the terminal, which has also failed to
evolve properly as an interface, but web designers could learn some
lessons from it. [Brandur](https://brandur.org) has written a [good
article](https://brandur.org/interfaces) on this subject.

I want the web to be fast. I want web software to have a native-like
interface. I want the web to go back to its decentralised roots. I want
the web to shed the over-burdened designs that have made it so hard to
get information out of many websites. This is just a small corner of a
very large information ocean, but it is my corner, and I will make it as
I want it to be.
