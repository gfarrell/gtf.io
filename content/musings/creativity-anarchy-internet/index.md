I miss the Old Internet. I miss the terrible flash games, raw vlogs,
websites with bad styling and unpolished content. I'm often unsure as
to why I miss this era of barely functional websites, overloaded with
visual noise, especially when comparing to what we have now, where I can
access a smorgasbord of media, journalism, and services.

In reality, this nostalgia for the internet of my teenagedom is not
really about a direct comparison of the quality of the content; I do not
just have a nostalgia for the rustic web. It is really about what we
have steadily lost in the modern era of highly monetised, polished, and
carefully tuned content creation.

When the web started to be more widely adopted, and blogs started
to be published (normally the work of just a single author) in the
1990s, it was an amazingly democratic platform. It was not democratic
in all dimensions as it did often require some technical knowledge
to successfully run a website, but the lack of any dominant content
platforms meant that there were no gatekeepers, and no platform owners
who could change the rules, and make rulings on what could and could not
be published, what would and would not be seen.

The printing press allowed the wide dissemination of material to
consumers outside of elite control. The early web completed the other
side of this process, opening up content creation to anyone with a
terminal (or a nearby internet café).

The result was a wild and anarchic jumble of content, often heavily
experimental and often quite useless. Much of the content from this
period was relatively unfiltered and very unpolished. The fact that the
web was less centralised and that social media had not yet enabled the
VirtuMob(TM) meant that people could express themselves more freely and
could experiment with ideas and content more freely. The web felt safer
as a space for new ideas. and the monetisation machine had not yet taken
hold of content creation.

The web of today is quite a different story. Of course there are still
individual blogs (like this one), and it is far from impossible to
launch your own content on your own platform as the architecture of
the internet has not fundamentally changed from that perspective,
but we have seen two worrying trends (one caused by the other). The
first is the increasing monetisation of content via advertising on the
internet. Some content creators make {{< cite atlantic-lets-play >}}huge
amounts of money{{< /cite >}} in advertising revenue. The second trend,
related to the first given the advertising model of the internet, is the
centralisation of content in a limited number of platforms like YouTube,
Facebook, Medium, even Wikipedia (which I think should be treated
separately).

{{< fig "images/iab-revenues.png" "Online advertising revenues from 2000 - 2017 from the IAB reports prepared by PWC." >}}

Since 2000, the monetisation of content on the internet has {{< cite
"iab-revenues" >}}increased massively{{< /cite >}}, from $8.23B in 2000
to $88B in 2017. The huge increase in advertising revenue over this
period could be down to some combination of three factors: increased
internet adoption resulting in more views and therefore clicks on
adverts; improved advertising technology, providing a higher converstion
rate as well as more placement opportunities; and finally, increased
awareness and adoption from advertisers resulting in a higher overall
budget allocation.

As advertising revenue has increased, the overall effect is that the
incentive for users to consume content is much higher. This has two
results: platform centralisation and content optimisation.

Platform centralisation is a fairly obvious effect of this, since
dominating the space provides a multiplier effect on the increasing
revenue to be gained. This drive towards a monopoly happens in
many markets, but the difference in this one is that the market
is advertising, but the effect is on content platforms. We expect
advertising revenue to support content platforms, but in reality content
is merely a hook to provide consumers for advertising.

There is a tension here, in that access to publishing (and even the
web itself) was much more restricted to the well off and those with
specialist knowledge (like how to host a blog). In that sense the
earlier web was _less_ democratic, but for those who were able to
publish and consume content (arguably, therefore, an elite), the web was
far _more_ democratic. Content was given more equal weighting in the
absence of algorithmic control and the monetisation drive.

While the centralisation of these platforms has made it easier for a
wider array of people to publish content online (which one might argue
has increased the democratisation of the web), it also means that there
are a smaller number of gatekeepers of content, and whether a piece of
content gets seen by a given user is now dictated by a dwindling number
of these gatekeepers. Platforms are heavily incentivised to funnel
content that they believe is most likely to keep a user on the platform,
thereby generating more advertising revenue, as well as to use {{< cite
"guardian-sv-dystopia" >}}psychological tricks{{< /cite >}} to {{< cite
"guardian-sean-parker-fb" >}}keep users engaged{{< /cite >}}. This is
well illustrated by {{< cite "aeon-porn" >}}an article in aeon about
online pornography{{< /cite >}}:

Similarly, as the platforms centralise and increase the efficacy of
their content funnelling, driving increased advertising revenues,
content creators are incentivised to produce content that the big data
machine suggests will maximise viewership and engagement. The result is
that content experimentation and diversity now carries a high cost in
terms of lost revenues. Whilst previously there was a cost associated
with a "flop", for example a movie taking in low earnings at the box
office, it was much harder to know what would flop and what would
succeed. The introduction of large datasets on user behaviour and tastes
(although it is difficult to say how accurate the analyses resulting
from these datasets really are) has meant that it is now much easier
for content creators wishing to maximise advertising revenues to craft
content that is most likely to appeal to audiences.

Once again, where once we would have expected creators to supplement their
incomes using advertising, the tail is now wagging the dog in that content
creation is being driven by advertising.

There are two pernicious effects arising from this. Since there is not
an infinite supply of content, it is impossible to tailor it to each
individual's tastes. Even were it possible, it would be undesirable
in the same way that the {{< cite "wiki-brave-new-world" >}}soma in
Aldous Huxley's Brave New World{{< /cite >}} is undesirable: if we only
ever get what we want, then our worldview will never expand beyond its
present confines as we will never be exposed to anything that does
not perfectly accord with our own views and tastes. In any case, by
tailoring content to some audience group of size greater than one, we
end up promoting certain tastes above others. The result will be groups
that converge to a particular set of tastes as they are increasingly
exposed to them.

Not only will we have increasingly isolated, intraconvergent groups
of consumers of content, the content itself will be converging to the
mean for each group. Anything that deviates from the local maxima of
engagement for each group will quickly be discarded due to the high
rewards from advertising revenues. This has serious implications for our
cultural output as society, as we focus increasingly on producing the
equivalent of bubble gum for the mind - endlessly chewable, increasingly
devoid of flavour, sufficiently sweet but insufficiently anything else,
and certainly unlikely to challenge our perceptions of taste.
