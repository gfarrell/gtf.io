## Notes from MDLI

* Access to the web in the earlier days (e.g. 1990s) was actually not
that democratic as it was confined to a smaller group of more elite
people. This is an inherent tension as increased access to content (both
consumption and publishing) then results in centralisation / corporate
capture. This tension should probably be explicitly acknowledged.
* Good examples for this piece are Instagram, Youtube, Facebook, Google,
Medium, Twitter. Examples of platforms. Youtube has lots of videos on
makeup and consumer products on YT. Look at trends / size of cosmetics
industry, an explosion might be down to online advertorials. Sponsored
content is sort of stealth advertising and is advertising masquerading
as content which means not really very honest or creative.
* How advertising affects gatekeepers vs. how advertising affects
creators (sponsored content etc.).

### For another essay

* Needs some more anecdotes. Examples of the most subtle but most
insidious ways that advertising happens. E.g. Ebates, Honey. E.g.
insurance companies using healthcare data and incentivising users to
supply data. (For another essay I think)
* This could be a series, psychology of internet consumption. Shorter
cycles from advert-to-buy given don't have to leave the house to go to
a shop, so no consideration of the pros/cons of the purchase. Pushes
people towards instant gratification. Part one is how advertising
changed the internet, part II is how internet changed consumption.
