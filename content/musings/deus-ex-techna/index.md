There is never any shortage of existential threats to human society.
Whether flood, drought, or invading army, fake news, global pandemics,
or rampant AI, these have a common theme: it is uniquely within our
control to avoid them entirely or mitigate their effects.

Unfortunately, humans do not like to change their behaviour, especially
if that behavioural change induces any form of present pain. Even when
we know exactly how we need to change our behaviour, we still avoid it.
Past societies might be forgiven their ignorance, but many of our modern
societies have understood the crises on the horizon but have made no
real attempt to avert them, or, if we have, the cost of such evasive
action has been extremely high because we have left it so late.

Our dislike of inducing present-pain through behavioural change, which
is hard, coupled with the fact that these crises often have complex
causes and solutions which induces a great deal of uncertainty,
results in a desparate search to find a solution _extra nos_. In
the past, this might have entailed an entreaty (or a surrender) to
divine or supernatural forces. Modern societies have killed the
Gods, and replaced them with a pantheon of _Techne_, most often
technologies that few understand{{< footnote >}}Therefore making them
very appropriate replacements for the Gods, since, as Arthur C. Clarke
noted, &ldquo;any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable
from magic.&rdquo;{{< /footnote >}}.

It may seem ungenerous to compare the modern faith in technological
solutions to human problems with historic resignation to the will of
the Gods, but for most people (including those at the forefront of
the technology industry) this comparison seems apt. This manifests in
a couple of similar narratives, subtly distinct only in the level of
agency they accord to the speaker: either it is that we have faith that
a technology will be developed to avert disaster, or it is that the
only way to avert this crisis is to develop the technology to resolve
it. Both these narratives remove any onus on individuals and societies
to change their behaviour, something which is often coupled with the
statement that an individual cannot hope to make a significant impact in
any case, and therefore should not bother to try.

This narrative is soothing because, in the face of an enormous and
scary potential crisis, the thought that we _ought_ to be acting (and
therefore the inevitable guilt or shame we feel when our aversion to
discomfort causes us not to act) is taken away, for there is nothing
that we as individuals or societies need to do. Technology will save us.

Yet this narrative rests on an unsound basis: that the perceived rate
of technological change in recent history implies that some, currently
unimaginable solution will emerge. This is far from guaranteed, as there
is no natural law which requires that technology be invented to avert
disasters. Furthermore, it is unclear that real technological change is
occurring at an ever-increasing rate, compared to previous points over
the last century.

Furthermore, while we have often been successful in our use of
technology to resist any requirement to change our behaviours, this
is still avoiding the underlying problem which is, ultimately, the
behaviours and values of the societies in which we live. These are
solely within our power to change (and, one might argue, our duty).

There are many recent examples of where this form of techno-optimism{{<
footnote >}}Alternatively, techno-fatalism, but to me this also
implies a whole raft of other issues in which people resign themselves
to the &lsquo;inevitability&rsquo; of some systems like surveillance
capitalism.{{< /footnote >}} is most egregious (at least in my milieu).

Firstly, there are the political problems like Brexit, Trump, and the
rise of majoritarian populists{{< footnote >}}Populist is an overused,
and overburdened term. Here I mean a politician who sets up a dichotomy
between &lsquo;the people&rsquo; and &lsquo;the elite&rsquo;. This
often is tied up with a form of majoritarianism and nativism, but
not necessarily.{{< /footnote >}}. The causes of these problems are
complicated and not settled questions, but broadly speaking they are
social. Whilst it is tempting to blame the Brexit vote, or the election
of Trump, on factors _extra nos_ like racism, social media and fake
news, or Russian interference, the truth is that we have developed
deeply divided societies with vast gulfs of inequality. Racism, fake
news, social media, and Russian interference (maybe not so much the
lattermost) all had a part to play, but if there were not already
fertile ground for these things caused by some form of discontent,
then they would not have taken root. Yet we focus on these potential
causes because they do not say anything about our culpability, and
do not force us to examine our behaviours. Racism is a way of saying
that these people are _other_, perhaps even _evil_, and therefore it
is a problem with them not a problem with the society of which we are
all a part. Similarly, fake news is an invisible enemy, infecting our
minds, but ultimately coming from outside (the enemy being the social
media companies perhaps){{< footnote >}}And, of course, there is no way
we could ever be susceptible to it, only those other people are so
gullible.{{< /footnote >}}.

Secondly, there are the epistemic problems, of which fake news is
the most recent incarnation. Disinformation has a long history, but
ultimately this, too, is a social problem driven by divisions in society
politically, economically, and educationally. There is also a deeper
epistemic problem which will be the subject of another essay I have
been meaning to write for some time. Ignoring, for the time being,
the epistemic problem, the job of closing the divisions in society
which provide fertile ground for disinformation (or, sometimes just
misconceptions) is a human job. It is up to us to create societies in
which debate flourishes but in which we can agree on basic truths and
values (or, if we cannot, we can at least disagree productively). Yet
much of the debate focusses instead on the duty of the social media
companies to invent new technologies which will root out fake news, or,
worse, to act as arbiters of truth, digital Big Brothers making sure we
think right.

Thirdly, the elephants in the room: environmentally-driven disasters
like climate change and global pandemics{{< footnote >}}When I first
drafted this essay in mid-2019, the coronavirus pandemic was not even
something I would have considered a possibility. How quickly our
lives have changed!{{< /footnote >}}. This is where I would consider
techno-optimism to be at its most fanatical and most dangerous. We have
known about the causes of climate change since {{< cite sawyer-ghg
>}}at least the 1970s{{< /cite >}}. Combatting climate change will
take serious changes to our societies, expectations, and behaviours as
individuals. It will affect everything: our attitude to food production
(especially cheap meat), our extreme wastefulness of materials, our
&lsquo;need&rsquo; for instant delivery and satisfaction of every whim
(the fact that Amazon Prime Now exists is testament to this). Yet even
sacrificing some of these very minor comforts like next-day delivery
seems unthinkable to large parts of our societies, and if we cannot
even drop those more basic things, what hope is there for large-scale
reform of our material consumption patterns, or food production systems?
Instead, we focus on technological solutions &mdash; perhaps it will be
carbon-capture technologies, or we will drive down manufacturing to be
carbon neutral, or, screw it, we can just jet off to Mars and settle
that planet instead. None of these technological solutions require us
to change how we act, and most of them are sufficiently magical to most
people that they are no different to praying to the Gods to take pity on
us. Perhaps prayer was more honest, for at least it does not assume that
we _will_ be saved.

Writing in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, it is worth noting
that there has been an enormous shift in behaviour in the majority of
societies across the globe. We have gone into complete lockdown, and in
the UK vast tracts of the population are being supported directly by the
government paying their wages. This was totally unimaginable six months
ago. COVID-19 is a direct and present threat, and our response has been
appropriate, but more notable is the fact that we knew that this was a
threat, and we knew we were underprepared and yet we did nothing. There
were plenty of warnings, {{< cite sars >}}SARS in the early 2000s{{<
/cite >}}, {{< cite mers >}}MERS from 2012 onwards{{< /cite >}}, {{<
cite swine-flu >}}swine flu in 2009{{< /cite >}}, {{< cite avian-flu
>}}avian flu in 2013{{< /cite >}}, and {{< cite ebola >}}ebola from
2013{{< /cite >}}. Perhaps, however, there is some hope. This crisis has
shown that we _can_ effect massive social change, and that our paradigms
for the role of the state _can_ change quickly. The real question with
this pandemic is whether we will address the underlying causes of it, or
whether our behaviour will revert to type, given enough time. Moreover,
when faced with far more consequential, and slow moving, threats like
climate change, will we act or will we pray?

We are facing some enormous challenges as a species, but also as
individual societies, and if we are to have any hope of overcoming
them, ultimately we must take direct responsibility for the world we
want to create. This is a singularly political act. The creation of new
technologies has a part to play but this cannot be seen as a replacement
for social change. This will involve huge changes to our behaviours,
and some of those changes will be uncomfortable at first. Yet if we do
not take ownership, and acknowledge that human problems require human
solutions, then we are only fooling ourselves: the deus ex techna is
not guaranteed and the Gods will not take pity on us.
