There is never any shortage of existential threats to human society.
Whether flood, drought, or invading army, fake news, global pandemics,
or rampant AI, these have a common theme: it is uniquely within our
control to avoid them entirely or mitigate their effects.

Unfortunately, humans do not like to change their behaviour, especially
if that behavioural change induces any form of present pain. Even when
we know, full well, how we need to change our behaviour, we still avoid
it. Past societies might be forgiven their ignorance, but many of our
modern societies have understood the crises on the horizon but have made
no real attempt to avert them, or, if we have, the cost of such evasive
action has been extremely high because we have left it so late.

Our dislike of inducing present-pain through behavioural change, which
is hard, results in a desparate search to find a solution _extra nos_.
In the past, this might have entailed an entreaty (or a surrender)
to divine or supernatural forces. Modern societies have killed the
Gods, and replaced them with a pantheon of _Techne_, most often
technologies that few understand{{< footnote >}}Therefore making them
very appropriate replacements for the Gods, since, as Arthur C. Clarke
noted, &ldquo;any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable
from magic.&rdquo;{{< /footnote >}}.

It may seem ungenerous to compare the modern faith in technological
solutions to human problems with historic resignation to the will of
the Gods, but for most people (including those at the forefront of
the technology industry) this comparison seems apt. This manifests in
a couple of similar narratives, subtly distinct only in the level of
agency they accord to the speaker: either it is that we have faith that
a technology will be developed to avert disaster, or it is that the
only way to avert this crisis is to develop the technology to resolve
it. Both these narratives remove any onus on individuals and societies
to change their behaviour, something which is often coupled with the
statement that an individual cannot hope to make a significant impact in
any case, and therefore should not bother to try.

This narrative is soothing because, in the face of an enormous and
scary potential crisis, the thought that we _ought_ to be acting (and
therefore the inevitable guilt or shame we feel when our aversion to
discomfort causes us not to act) is taken away, for there is nothing
that we as individuals or societies need to do. Yet it rests on a
unsound basis: we believe that because technology appears to advance at
an ever-increasing rate, unimaginable solutions will appear to these
problems but this is both far from guaranteed (there is no natural law
which requires that technology be invented to avert disasters), and
possibly based on a false premise -- that technology _is_ advancing at
an ever-increasing rate. If we compare some of the innovations over the
last century, it is not clear that the rate of serious breakthroughs
really is increasing (as new consumer applications do not, on this
scale, count as serious breakthroughts).

Furthermore, while we have often been successful in our use of
technology to resist any requirement to change our behaviours, this
is still avoiding the underlying problem which is, ultimately, the
behaviours and values of the societies in which we live. These are
solely within our power to change (and, one might argue, our duty).

There are many recent examples of where this is most egregious (at least
in my milieu).

Firstly, there are the political problems like Brexit, Trump, and the
rise of majoritarian populists{{< footnote >}}Populist is an overused,
and overburdened term. Here I mean a politician who sets up a dichotomy
between &lsquo;the people&rsquo; and &lsquo;the elite&rsquo;. This
often is tied up with a form of majoritarianism and nativism, but
not necessarily.{{< /footnote >}}. The causes of these problems are
complicated and not settled questions, but broadly speaking they are
social. Whilst it is tempting to blame the Brexit vote, or the election
of Trump, on factors _extra nos_ like racism, social media and fake
news, or Russian interference, the truth is that we have developed
deeply divided societies with vast gulfs of inequality. Racism, fake
news, social media, and Russian interference (maybe not so much the
lattermost) all had a part to play, but if there were not already
fertile ground for these things caused by some form of discontent,
then they would not have taken root. Yet we focus on these potential
causes because they do not say anything about our culpability, and
do not force us to examine our behaviours. Racism is a way of saying
that these people are _other_, perhaps even _evil_, and therefore it
is a problem with them not a problem with the society of which we are
all a part. Similarly, fake news is an invisible enemy, infecting our
minds, but ultimately coming from outside (the enemy being the social
media companies perhaps){{< footnote >}}And, of course, there is no way
we could ever be susceptible to it, only those _other_ people are so
gullible.{{< /footnote >}}.

Secondly, there are the epistemic problems, of which fake news is
the most recent incarnation. Disinformation has a long history, but
ultimately this, too, is a social problem driven by divisions in society
politically, economically, and educationally. There is also a deeper
epistemic problem which will be the subject of another essay I have
been meaning to write for some time. Ignoring, for the time being,
the epistemic problem, the job of closing the divisions in society
which provide fertile ground for disinformation (or, sometimes just
misconceptions) is a human job. It is up to us to create societies in
which debate flourishes but in which we can agree on basic truths and
values (or, if we cannot, we can at least disagree productively). Yet
much of the debate focusses instead on the duty of the social media
companies to invent new technologies which will root out fake news, or,
worse, to act as arbiters of truth, digital Big Brothers making sure we
think right.

Thirdly, the elephants in the room: environmentally-driven disasters
like climate change and global pandemics{{< footnote >}}When I first
drafted this essay in mid-2019, the coronavirus pandemic was not even
something I would have considered a possibility. How quickly our
lives have changed!{{< /footnote >}}. This is where I would consider
techno-optimism to be at its most fanatical and most dangerous.
Combatting climate change will take serious changes to our societies,
expectations, and behaviours as individuals. It will affect everything:
our attitude to food production (especially cheap meat), our extreme
wastefulness of materials, our &lsquo;need&rsquo; for instant delivery
and satisfaction of every whim (the fact that Amazon Prime Now exists
is testament to this). Yet even sacrificing some of these very minor
comforts like next-day delivery seems unthinkable to large parts of
our societies, and if we cannot even drop those more basic things,
what hope is there for large-scale reform of our material consumption
patterns, or food production systems? Instead, we focus on technological
solutions &mdash; perhaps it will be carbon-capture technologies, or we
will drive down manufacturing to be carbon neutral, or, screw it, we
can just jet off to Mars and settle that planet instead. None of these
technological solutions require us to change how we act, and most of
them are sufficiently magical to most people that they are no different
to praying to the Gods to take pity on us. Perhaps prayer was more
honest, for at least it does not assume that we _will_ be saved.

We are facing some enormous challenges as a species, but also as
individual societies, and if we are to have any hope of overcoming them,
ultimately we must take direct responsibility for the world we want to
create. This will involve huge changes to our behaviours, and some of
those changes will be uncomfortable, at least at first. Yet if we do
not take ownership, and acknowledge that human problems require human
solutions, then we are only fooling ourselves: the deus ex techna is not
guaranteed, and technology cannot solve social problems, it can only
obfuscate them and create new ones.
