I miss the Old Internet. I miss the terrible flash games, raw vlogs,
websites with bad styling and unpolished content. This is despite the
fact that they were overloaded with visual noise --- full of pictures,
marquee text, and design decisions that should never have seen the
light of day --- and were much more limited in functionality. When
comparing to what we have now, where I can access a smorgasbord of
media, journalism, and services, the early web was ugly, difficult to
use, and lacked much of the utility that today we take for granted.

In reality, this nostalgia for the internet of my teenagedom is not
really about a direct comparison of the quality of the content{{<
footnote >}}By "content", I mean everything that people produce
online, so that could be articles on newspaper websites, blog posts in
individual or syndicated blogs, videos on YouTube and Vimeo, imagery
from DeviantArt or Instagram, or even Tumblr, and online games.{{<
/footnote >}}. It is really about what we have steadily lost in the
modern era of highly monetised, polished, and carefully tuned content
creation.

When the web started to be more widely adopted, and blogs started to
be published (normally the work of just a single author) in the 1990s,
it was an amazingly egalitarian platform. It was not democratic in all
dimensions as it required some technical knowledge to successfully
run a website, not to mention the hardware and infrastructure that
was unavailable outside wealthier areas in wealthy countries. The
lack of any dominant content platforms like Youtube and Medium{{<
footnote >}}And, arguably, Google which, while not a platform, has such
control over people's access to content that it could be counted in
the same category.{{< /footnote >}}, however, meant that there were no
gatekeepers, and no platform owners who could change the rules. No-one
was there to make rulings on what could and could not be published, what
would and would not be seen.

Hyperlinks between documents stored on servers allowed users to discover
a wide range of content produced by a diversity of people who had no
particular affiliation to one another. Those hyperlinks were not created
by consensus, or by a publisher, but by the individual content creators
themselves. As such it was possible to discover a whole realm of content
without any directing force. This is what made the web what it was,
and such ideas are under threat both from {{< cite link-tax-jreda
>}}the stupidity of legislators {{< /cite >}} and our own forgetting,
thanks to the ubiquity of publishing platforms which seek to keep users
within their walls.

These platforms have had some positive social impacts, for example
circumventing authoritarian governments as with Twitter in Iran. In
the context of a mostly free society, however, their (increasing)
editorial control and ubiquity threatens the creativity and freedom
of the web. There is also an increasing trend of these platforms {{<
cite google-china >}}capitulating to the demands of authoritarian
governments{{< /cite >}} around the world, making them complicit in
locking subjugated populations out of the world of free (as in speech)
information.

While the printing press allowed the wide dissemination of material to
consumers outside of elite control, the early web completed the other
side of this process, opening up content creation to anyone with a
terminal (or a nearby internet café). Internet cafés in particular were
like the libraries of the early web --- not everyone could afford their
own, but many people could afford to {{< cite internet-cafe-history
>}}gain some access through a communal service{{< /cite >}} (although
this was not globally true).

The audiences of the printing press and early web were, on the face
of it, quite dissimilar. The printing press allowed the dissemination
of material embargoed by those in power (mostly the Church), for
example English-language bibles. By contrast, the early internet was
not primarily used as a method of circumventing content bans amongst
dissenters (although there was a certain degree of this, for example
with the sharing of hard-to-access or copyrighted material). What these
did have in common, however, was that they were being used to distribute
content amongst consumers in a non-commercial sense --- this was
information production and consumption for the sake of the information,
rather than for a financial model.

The result was a wild and anarchic jumble of content, often heavily
experimental spawning a wide variety of subcultures and niche interest
groups. Much of the content from this period was relatively unfiltered
and very unpolished. The fact that the web was less centralised and that
social media had not yet birthed the VirtuMob(TM) meant that people
could express themselves more freely and could experiment with ideas
and content (which is not to say that there were not a number of {{< cite brass-eye
>}}moral panics{{< /cite >}} and the like).

The web of today is quite a different story. Of course there are still
individual blogs (like this one), and it is far from impossible to
launch your own content on your own platform as the architecture of
the internet has not fundamentally changed from that perspective,
but we have seen two worrying trends (one caused by the other). The
first is the increasing monetisation of content via advertising on the
internet. Some content creators make {{< cite atlantic-lets-play >}}huge
amounts of money{{< /cite >}} in advertising revenue. The second trend,
related to the first given the advertising model of the internet, is the
centralisation of content in a limited number of platforms like YouTube,
Facebook, Medium, and even Wikipedia{{< footnote >}}Wikipedia is a very
different type of platform, given that it is inherently informational, and there
is normally a 1:1 relationship between that for which a user is searching and
the articles themselves. It is also not supported by advertising, and is
volunteer run. Nevertheless it is worth mentioning as it has become the
predominant knowledge repository online.{{< /footnote >}}.

There is a tension here, in that access to publishing (and even the
web itself) was much more restricted to the well-off and those with
specialist knowledge (like how to host a blog), and access to hardware
and infrastructure. In that sense the earlier web was less democratic,
but for those who were able to publish and consume content (arguably,
therefore, an elite), the web was far more egalitarian. Content was
weighted more equally in the absence of data-driven search engines
and publishing and dissemination platforms (like Google, Facebook,
and Twitter) which control "feeds" of information. This tension
is inevitable, as the democratisation or opening-up of the web to
increasing numbers of publishers and consumers drove the potential
for monetisation, which then decreased the openness and balance of
the entire ecosystem. Thus as this open and egalitarian space was
"democratised" by being opened up to the wider population, the same
features that made is open and egalitarian also created the space and
incentives for the platforms that would eventually cause a reversal in
this openness and freedom.

Perhaps it is the case that it is only really possible to have freedom
of creativity amongst some form of elite or restricted group. This is
rather an uncomfortable conclusion but there are some obvious reasons
for it. Wider accessibility means that the majority consumer is not in
the early-adopter category, and therefore has a different tolerance to
new ideas and imperfect content. There is often a sense of snobbery
accompanying talk of "mass" or "common" markets, but it seems to be
inherently true that anything made for a wider market will both be
influenced by primarily economic forces (rather than producers operating
according to some other motivator), as well as consumed primarily by
those with little patience for the experimental.

{{< fig

"Online advertising revenues from 2000 - 2017, compiled from the IAB reports prepared by PWC." >}}

Since 2000, the monetisation of content on the internet has {{< cite
"iab-revenues" >}}increased massively{{< /cite >}}, from $8.23B in 2000
to $88B in 2017. The huge increase in advertising revenue over this
period could be down to some combination of three factors: increased
internet adoption resulting in more views and therefore clicks on
adverts; improved advertising technology, providing a higher conversion
rate as well as more placement opportunities; and finally, increased
awareness and adoption from advertisers resulting in a higher overall
budget allocation.

As advertising revenue has increased, there is a resulting increase
in the incentive to create content with which to draw users in. This
has two results: platform centralisation, and content optimisation and
convergence.

Platform centralisation is a fairly obvious effect of this, since
dominating the space provides a multiplier effect on the increasing
revenue to be gained. This drive towards a monopoly happens in
many markets, but the difference in this one is that the market is
advertising, whereas the effect is on the content platforms. We expect
advertising revenue to support content platforms, but in reality content
is merely a hook to provide consumers for advertising.

While the centralisation of these platforms has made it easier for a
wider array of people to publish content online (thus increasing the
democratisation of the web), it also means that there are a smaller
number of gatekeepers of content, and whether a piece of content gets
seen by a given user is now dictated by a dwindling number of these
gatekeepers. Platforms are heavily incentivised to funnel content
that they believe is most likely to keep a user on the platform,
thereby generating more advertising revenue, as well as to use {{< cite
"guardian-sv-dystopia" >}}psychological tricks{{< /cite >}} to {{< cite
"guardian-sean-parker-fb" >}}keep users engaged{{< /cite >}}. This is
well illustrated by {{< cite "aeon-porn" >}}an article in aeon about
online pornography{{< /cite >}}:

> Powered by ad revenue, the tube sites felt an economic tug to draw
> more people to their sites for longer chunks of time. Since they had –
> at least initially – no control over content creation, the name of the
> game on tube sites for the past few years was content funnelling.

Similarly, as the platforms centralise and increase the efficacy of
their content funnelling, driving increased advertising revenues,
content creators are incentivised to produce content that the big
data machine suggests will maximise viewership and engagement. The
result is that content experimentation and diversity now carries a high
cost in terms of lost revenues. Whilst previously there was a cost
associated with a "flop", for example a movie taking in low earnings
at the box office, it was much harder to know what would flop and what
would succeed. The introduction of large datasets ("big data") on user
behaviour and tastes (although it is difficult to say how accurate the
analyses resulting from these datasets really are) has meant that it is
now much easier for content creators wishing to maximise advertising
revenues to use big data to craft content that is most likely to appeal
to their desired audiences.

Where once we would have expected creators to supplement their incomes
using advertising, the tail is now wagging the dog in that content
creation is being driven by advertising.

Within the context of the web, as content platforms have increased their
ubiquity, content creators are very much subject to their control. While
one might argue that if the technology is simply doing a more efficient
job of matching up what content creators are producing with audience's
tastes{{< footnote >}}Dealing with actual tastes vs. what different
audiences want to project to others by virtue of their perceived tastes
is somewhat beyond the scope of this essay.{{< /footnote >}} then it
is serving a worthwhile purpose. Before the technology provided such a
complete picture (regardless of accuracy) of what might be popular, in
the face of such uncertainty, diversity flourished as only with some
failures could the successes fall out of the mix. While inefficient in
terms of generating popular content, this diversity is important to our
culture, as it allows new ideas to grow without being culled too early
by a hallowed model of popularity.

There are two pernicious effects arising from this. Since there is not
an infinite supply of content, it is impossible to tailor it to each
individual's tastes. Even were it possible, it would be undesirable:
if we only ever get what we want, then our worldview will never expand
beyond its present confines as we will never be exposed to anything that
does not perfectly accord with our own views and tastes{{< footnote
>}}There's an analogy in the numbing effects of Soma in Brave New World,
but it is not an exact one.{{< /footnote >}}. In any case, by tailoring
content to some audience group of size greater than one, we end up
promoting certain tastes above others. The result will be groups that
converge to a particular set of tastes as they are increasingly exposed
to them.

Not only will we have increasingly isolated, intraconvergent groups
of consumers of content, the content itself will be converging to the
mean for each group. Anything that deviates from the local maxima of
engagement for each group will quickly be discarded due to the high
rewards from advertising revenues. This has serious implications for our
cultural output as society, as we focus increasingly on producing the
equivalent of bubble gum for the mind - endlessly chewable, increasingly
devoid of flavour, sufficiently sweet but insufficiently anything else,
and certainly unlikely to challenge our ideas.
