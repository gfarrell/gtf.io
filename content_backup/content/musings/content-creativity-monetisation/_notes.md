## Notes from LFC

* I think that it’s worth highlighting the importance of the hyperlink,
which is perhaps the most important element in the web and why the web
is called "the web" (lol). As time went by we lost awareness of this
amazing idea which allowed us to get to the weirdest corners of the
internet.
* Also due to the centralization of content the web is less inventive.
I remember writing crawlers for forums, bots for online games and that
sort of thing. In a certain way, the entry barrier for publishing
content was also what made possibilities endless. This is kind of the
same problem with GUIs vs. CLIs. It limits you to the extent of what
platform creators want you to do.
* The reference to Aldous Huxley was brilliant and also very well
aligned with the post-truth age (do you use this term in English as
well?) we live in. I find many people referencing 1984 when they talk
about this, but Brave New World is much more accurate IMO. Well thought.

## Notes from MDLI

* Access to the web in the earlier days (e.g. 1990s) was actually not
that democratic as it was confined to a smaller group of more elite
people. This is an inherent tension as increased access to content (both
consumption and publishing) then results in centralisation / corporate
capture. This tension should probably be explicitly acknowledged.
* Good examples for this piece are Instagram, Youtube, Facebook, Google,
Medium, Twitter. Examples of platforms. Youtube has lots of videos on
makeup and consumer products on YT. Look at trends / size of cosmetics
industry, an explosion might be down to online advertorials. Sponsored
content is sort of stealth advertising and is advertising masquerading
as content which means not really very honest or creative.
* How advertising affects gatekeepers vs. how advertising affects
creators (sponsored content etc.).

### For another essay

* Needs some more anecdotes. Examples of the most subtle but most
insidious ways that advertising happens. E.g. Ebates, Honey. E.g.
insurance companies using healthcare data and incentivising users to
supply data. (For another essay I think)
* This could be a series, psychology of internet consumption. Shorter
cycles from advert-to-buy given don't have to leave the house to go to
a shop, so no consideration of the pros/cons of the purchase. Pushes
people towards instant gratification. Part one is how advertising
changed the internet, part II is how internet changed consumption.

## Selection of Sam's notes (for another essay)

The creativity you are talking about here is itself quite specific. I’d nuance this paragraph….also how might this so-called elite (the tech crew at Burning man?) make more options for democrotisation possible (hardware in developing world; TOR in countries with firewalls or whagever) and how might they also encourage the reporuposing of mass platforms for forms of techno-political resitance etc. (using the fixed tools creatively). You are fetishizing a particular idea(l) of the experimental IMHO, not without good reason but still.  I wonder if there are academic articles about, say, coders in Kenya, hackers in Rio, all of whom might be doing interesting things creatively (I don’t know, just a guess)
