  All about the motivation and reasoning behind the inception and design
  of my personal website, built on Hugo (which is written in Go), with a
  minimalist (if not Spartan) aesthetic. The website is designed to be
  very fast with almost no resources being loaded, and, importantly, no
  tracking scripts.

Over the last 15 or so years I have cycled through many websites, from
early ones built in Dreamweaver through _very_ animated, interactive
sites in Flash followed by my own PHP CMS, and eventually back to
static sites. I have also tried blogging several times, with Wordpress
initially, then Ghost, and a little with Medium.

This website was the result of a desire to have a simple, fully-static
site which I could use to host various [musings](/musings) and
[projects](/projects), as well as other things in time.

The design is purposefully spartan. Web design often seems to favour
form over function. This is not just a contemporary issue, in the early
2000s, heavy use of blinking, attention grabbing effects, and marquee
text were legendary. It is also not simply an amateur problem, plenty of
professional designers are producing (sometimes) aesthetically beautiful
websites, but these are hard to use, or hard to read, or sometimes so
filled with white space as to resemble a piste at the start of the
season.

I am not a designer. I do have a fairly strong aesthetic sense, but
coming up with great designs is not my main skill. At the moment I am
trying to strip everything back, except what is necessary. I spend a
lot of my time in a terminal, and a lot of modern web-based software
has drifted very far from this sort of responsive (in terms of speed),
powerful interface. Most web software is slow, and feels unnatural
to use. For me, the epitome of usability is something like `vim`,
despite the steep learning curve. `vim` allows me to be extremely
productive if I am willing to invest the time into understanding how
it works, but I can also use its basic functionality by just sitting
in insert mode as if I were using `nano`. I do not want the web to
be just like the terminal, which has also failed to evolve properly
as an interface, but web designers could [learn some lessons from
it](https://brandur.org/interfaces).

I want the web to be fast. I want web software to have a native-like
interface. I want the web to go back to its decentralised roots. I want
the web to shed the over-burdened designs that have made it so hard to
get information out of many websites. This is just a small corner of a
very large information ocean, but it is my corner, and I will make it as
I want it to be.
